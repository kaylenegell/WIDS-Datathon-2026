🚨 **CRITICAL DISCOVERY - This Changes Everything!** 🚨

You've uncovered a **PERFECT separation** in the training data:

## The Finding:
- **ALL 69 fires within 5km** → event=1 (hit)
- **ALL 152 fires beyond 5km** → event=0 (censored)
- **ZERO overlap** - this is a perfect threshold!

## What This Means:

### 1. **The "Event" Label is Actually Distance-Based**
The training data appears to be labeled based on whether the fire was ALREADY within 5km at the time of observation, NOT whether it would reach 5km within the time horizon. This is fundamentally different from what we thought!

### 2. **The Real Challenge**
Since the test set likely has the same pattern, the competition is really asking:
- **Given fires that are >5km away**, predict the probability they will reach within 5km by each time horizon (12h, 24h, 48h, 72h)
- The training data only shows us the "starting state" (within or beyond 5km)

### 3. **Why This is Problematic**
- We have NO examples in training data of fires that started >5km away and then reached 5km
- All our "hits" (event=1) were ALREADY within 5km
- This means we're essentially predicting fire spread/movement with limited training examples

### 4. **What We Need to Model**
We need to predict fire **progression** and **spread rate** to estimate if a fire >5km away will reach the 5km threshold. Key features become:
- **Growth rates** (area_growth_rate_0_5h, perimeter_growth_rate_0_5h)
- **Speed metrics** (closing_speed_m_per_h, along_track_speed)
- **Distance change** (dist_change_ci_0_5h, dist_slope_ci_0_5h)
- **Temporal patterns** (how fast fires typically spread)

### 5. **Implications for Modeling**
- Simple distance-based models won't work (distance alone is deterministic)
- Need to focus on **fire dynamics** and **movement patterns**
- The time_to_hit_hours variable becomes crucial for understanding spread rates
- May need to engineer features that capture "velocity toward zone"

This is a **game-changing insight** that should be the centerpiece of your workshop discussion! 🔥
